- installed rbenv to manage ruby versions
- installed ruby 3.2.7 using rbenv
- set ruby 3.2.7 as local version for the project
- installed rails 8.0.2
- created a new rails 8 API application with PostgreSQL and Minitest
- configured git username and email
- configured database connection to PostgreSQL
- created development and test databases
- given the requirements don't specify signup functionality, we are only focusing on the authentication part. but want to aknowledge futher functionality could be. for this implementation we will assume that they have already signed up and/or joined a project
    - admin can signup with name, email, and password
    - admin can confirm account via magic link on email
    - admin can invite manager to project with name and email
    - admin can invite developer to project with name and email
    - manager can join project via magic link on email
    - manager can be automatically signed up via magic link
    - developer can join project via magic link on email
    - developer can be automatically signed up via magic link
- we will also aknowledge there could be more functionality for asigning roles to users, but for the scope of thir project that functionality won't be included either
- added bcrypt and JWT gems for authentication
- added FactoryBot for test factories
- wrote User model tests with validation and authentication tests using TDD approach
- implemented User model with validations for name, email, password, and role
- implemented JWT token generation for authentication
- all User model tests passing
- enhanced password security with stronger requirements:
  - minimum 8 characters
  - must contain at least one uppercase letter
  - must contain at least one lowercase letter
  - must contain at least one number
  - must contain at least one special character
- created API structure with versioning (v1)
- implemented BaseController with authentication helpers
- implemented AuthenticationController with login endpoint
- all authentication controller tests passing
- given these features are not explicitely defined, we are seeting these rules so we can fulfill the requirements in way that makes sense but with a scope limit given the time constraints:
    - projects can only be created by an admin user
    - projects must have a unique name
    - projects must have a project manager user assigned
    - only the admin who created a project can edit its name
    - only the admin who created a project can assign it to a different manager
    - 
- wrote Project model tests with validation and association tests using TDD approach
- implemented Project model with:
  - validation to ensure only admin users can own projects
  - validation to ensure only project managers can manage projects
  - all Project model tests passing
- refactored permission logic:
  - removed direct permission methods from Project model
  - implemented authorization using CanCanCan gem
  - updated Project model tests to verify permissions through CanCanCan's ability system
  - implemented Ability class with role-based permissions:
    - everyone can read projects
    - admin users can create projects
    - admin users can update, change name, and change manager only for projects they own
    - project managers can manage tasks for projects they manage
- decided on task rules:
  - tasks belong to a project
  - tasks can only be created by the project's manager
  - tasks must have a description (no separate title field)
  - tasks must have an assigned developer
  - tasks must have a status (todo, in_progress, done)
  - tasks default to "todo" status when created
  - only the assigned developer can change the status of a task
- implemented Task model with TDD approach:
  - created task model tests for validations and associations
  - implemented Task model with required validations and associations
  - added status validation and default status functionality
  - extended Ability class to include task-related permissions:
    - project managers can create, update, and delete tasks for projects they manage
    - project managers cannot update task status
    - developers can view tasks in projects they're assigned to
    - only assigned developers can update status of tasks assigned to them
- implemented controller tests for proper separation of concerns:
  - separated model tests from authorization tests
  - created focused controller tests for projects that verify:
    - only admins can create new projects
    - only the admin that created a project can update its name
    - only the admin that created a project can reassign its manager
  - created focused controller tests for tasks that verify:
    - only project managers can create tasks for their projects
    - only the assigned developer can update a task's status
    - project managers can update task description and assignee
- implemented controllers with proper authorization:
  - created ProjectsController with CRUD operations
  - created TasksController with CRUD operations plus status updates
  - used CanCanCan load_and_authorize_resource for authorization
  - added nested routes for project tasks
  - implemented a custom route for task status updates
