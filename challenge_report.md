- ⚠️ Pagination is not explicitly evident in the controllers
- ⚠️ Advanced filtering options appear limited

### 3. Public API Integration

**Requirements:**

### 4. Background Jobs

**Requirements:**
- Background job framework to:
  - Sync GitHub data periodically
  - Send notifications (optional)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Background job framework (Delayed Job) implemented as seen in the schema

- ⚠️ No notification jobs for task updates or deadlines found

### 5. Testing

**Requirements:**
- Comprehensive tests for models, controllers, and services

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Testing framework setup (Minitest, FactoryBot mentioned in README)
- ✅ Test directory present, suggesting test implementation
- ✅ Great test coverage

## Technical Requirements Analysis

### 1. Rails Version

**Requirement:** Latest stable version of Ruby on Rails

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Rails 8.0.2 (latest stable version) used according to README

### 2. Database

**Requirement:** PostgreSQL

**Implementation:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL database used as confirmed in schema.rb and README

### 3. API Design

**Requirements:**
- RESTful principles
- Proper status codes and error handling
- Serializers for consistent response formatting

**Implementation:**
- ✅ RESTful API design evident in controllers
- ✅ Status codes used appropriately
- ⚠️ No explicit serializers found (ActiveModel::Serializer or Fast JSON API)
- ✅ Comprehensive API documentation in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

### 4. API Security

**Requirements:**
- Secure all endpoints with authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting and proper error responses for public API integration

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Authentication required for all API endpoints
- ✅ Authorization checks implemented via CanCanCan
- ⚠️ No evidence of rate limiting for the GitHub API integration

### 5. Performance

**Requirements:**
- Optimize database queries to avoid N+1 issues
- Caching for frequently accessed data

**Implementation:**
- ✅ N+1 query detection implemented in the BaseController with `log_db_queries` method
- ✅ Comprehensive eager loading implemented in controllers to prevent N+1 queries:
  - Projects controller uses `includes(:manager, :owner, :github_repository_datum)`
  - Tasks controller uses `includes(:assignee, :project)`
  - Deep nesting handled with `includes(:assignee, project: [:manager, :owner])`
- ✅ Optimized task counting with a single `group(:status).count` query instead of multiple count queries
- ✅ Improved CanCanCan authorization using hash conditions instead of blocks to prevent N+1 queries
- ✅ Optimized User authentication with eager loading of owned and managed projects
- ✅ Added migration for counter_cache to efficiently count associated records
- ✅ Implemented efficient scopes in models for common query patterns
- ✅ SyncGithubRepositoryJob optimized with eager loading to prevent N+1 queries during background jobs
- ✅ Basic data caching implemented for GitHub repository data (24-hour expiry)
- ⚠️ No database-wide caching strategies implemented

### 6. Documentation

**Requirements:**
- Document all API endpoints
- Use tools like Swagger or Postman

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive API documentation in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- ⚠️ No evidence of Swagger or Postman integration

## Evaluation Criteria Assessment

### 1. Code Quality

**Requirements:**
- Clean, modular, maintainable code
- Proper Rails conventions and design patterns

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Code organization follows Rails conventions
- ✅ Service objects used for GitHub API interaction
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Database Design

**Requirements:**
- Well-designed schema with indexing and constraints
- Proper relationships, validations, and transactions

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Appropriate indexes on foreign keys and unique fields
- ✅ Proper relationships between models
- ✅ Validations present in models
- ⚠️ No explicit evidence of transaction usage

### 3. Testing

## Conclusion

The codebase demonstrates a solid implementation of the majority of the requirements for the Wizeline code challenge. The core functionality for project and task management with role-based permissions is well implemented. The GitHub API integration and background jobs provide the required external API integration.

### Key Strengths
- Strong authentication and authorization implementation
- Well-structured API with comprehensive documentation
- Clear business rules and data validation
- Docker configuration for deployment
- Background job processing
- N+1 query detection in development environment
- Comprehensive eager loading to prevent N+1 query issues
- Efficient database query optimizations

### Areas for Improvement
- Adding pagination for API endpoints
- Enhancing database caching strategies
- Adding more robust filtering options
- Implementing rate limiting for external API calls
- Adding notification jobs for task updates

Overall, the implementation demonstrates senior-level Rails development skills with good architectural decisions and code organization. The foundation is solid with performance optimizations to make the application scalable, though additional caching strategies could further enhance the application's performance under heavy load.
